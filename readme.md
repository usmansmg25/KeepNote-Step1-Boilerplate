## Seed code - Boilerplate for step 1 - Keep Note Assignment

### Assignment Step Description

As a first step in building our Keep Note application, we will create a monolithic application. 

A monolithic application is built as a single unit. Enterprise Applications are built in three parts: 
1. A database (consisting of many tables usually in a relational database management system), 
2. A client-side user interface (consisting of HTML pages and/or JavaScript running in a browser), 
3. A server-side application. 

This server-side application will handle HTTP requests, execute some domain specific logic, retrieve and update data from the persistence storage, and populate the HTML views to be sent to the browser. 

### Problem Statement

In this case study: Keep Note Step 1, we will develop a monolithic application which will get the note Id,title,content and status from the user using a form (JSP/HTML), persist the data in Array List and display all notes with details such as note id,note title, note content,note status and LocalDateTime of posting in a reverse chronological order (atest note first).

**Note: For detailed clarity on the class files, kindly go thru the Project Structure**
### Expected solution
 A form containing four text fields for Note ID, Note Title, Note Content, Note Status and a submit button, below to this will be a tabular column with the fields Note ID, Note Title, Note Content and LocalDateTime(This will be published in reverse chronological order). 
 When the user enters the Note ID, Note Title, Note Content, Note Status and clicks on submit button, it gets stored in the array list and later render in tabular column.
 
### Following are the broad tasks:
1. Display the list of notes from the array list. Each note should contain Note ID, Title, Content, Status and created date. 
2. Add a new note which should contain the Note ID, Title, Content and Status.
3. Make sure to pass all the Unit test cases locally and on Hobbes.

### Steps to be followed :

    Step 1: Clone the boilerplate in a specific folder in your local machine and import the same in your eclipse STS.
    Step 2: Add relevant dependencies in pom.xml file. 
        Note: Read the comments mentioned in pom.xml file for identifying the relevant dependencies.
    Step 3: In resources/beans.xml, add the required bean elements for Note model and NoteRepository class.
    Step 4: Go through web.xml
    Step 5: In dispatcher-servlet.xml, add base packages to scan and define the bean for view resolver.
    Step 6: In Note.java file (which is considered as Model class), declare all the necessary variables for the model.
    Step 7: In NoteRepository.java, create methods to add/retrieve/update/delete notes from the Array List. 
       Also Write a method which is used to retrieve all notes from array list.
    Step 8: Run the test cases for NoteRepository(NoteRepositoryTest.java)
    Step 9: In NoteController.java, get the application context from resources/beans.xml file using ClassPathXmlApplicationContext() class.Also get Note and NoteRepository objects from the application 			context.Annotate the NoteController.java with @Controller annotation.
    	Define a handler method to read the existing notes from the ArrayList, to read the Note data from requested parameters and save the new note in the Array List and delete a note.
    Step 10: Run the testcases for NoteController (NoteControllerTest.java)
    Step 11: Design a form with four text boxes (Note id, title, content and status) and a submit button and A table which shows Note id, title, content, status and the created date.

### Project structure

#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in the folder **assignment-solution-step1** of your local machine
     
    `git clone https://gitlab-cts.stackroute.in/stack_java_keep/KeepNote-Step1-Boilerplate.git`

2. Navigate to assignment-solution-step1 folder

    `cd assignment-solution-step1`

3. Remove its remote or original reference

     `git remote rm origin`

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `assignment-solution-step1` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

     `git remote add origin https://gitlab-cts.stackroute.in/{{yourusername}}/assignment-solution-step1.git`

     **Note: {{yourusername}} should be replaced by your username from gitlab**

5. Check the status of your repo 
     
     `git status`

6. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
7. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

8. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed
